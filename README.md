# waveresponse-python
``waveresponse`` provides utilities for handling 2-D wave spectra and response amplitude
operators (RAOs) using the Python programming language.

The tools you get with ``waveresponse`` are useful for handling wave data and RAO
data on its own. However, the main intension of the package is to provide an easy-to-use
interface for estimating a vessel's frequency-domain response by combining wave
spectra with RAOs.
